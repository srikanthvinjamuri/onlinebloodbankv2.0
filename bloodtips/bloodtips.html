<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 jumbotron" style="background-color:#e6e6e6">
    <p>Good circulation depends on a number of factors: healthy blood that’s able to effectively carry oxygen and nutrients to the cells; a strong heart, capable of efficiently pumping this rich blood to all the body’s extremities and organs; normal blood pressure; and unclogged blood vessels. Here are some simple ways to boost your circulation every day.<br>
1. Drink tea<br>
Teas that are rich in antioxidants such as flavonoids, polyphenols and catechins can assist in the flow-mediated dilation of the arteries, which is indicative of arterial health, a study published in the journal Circulation reveals. White, green and black tea all increase the blood’s antioxidant status and further studies suggest that tea can help prevent heart disease, too.<br>
2. Eat more iron-rich foods<br>
Iron is a vital component of haemoglobin, the blood’s oxygen transporter, and deficiency in this mineral is the most widespread nutritional deficiency, according to the World Health Organization. Ensure you regularly include at least some of the following in your diet: red meat, wholegrain cereals, dark, leafy greens, lentils and kidney beans.<br>
3. Have less saturated fats<br>
“You don’t have to cut back on meat,” nutritionist Brigid McKevith says. “Just choose leaner cuts and try not to have too much full-fat dairy. Both of these dietary measures are important for circulatory health.”<br>
4. Monitor your weight and blood pressure<br>
If you’re overweight, losing kilos can help control blood pressure. The same applies to decreasing your intake of sodium, such as from salty processed foods, and increasing your potassium levels with foods such as dark, leafy greens and bananas. “Sodium, while a valuable mineral, tends to be stored in excess in the body,” nutritional therapist Elizabeth Harfleet says. “Too much sodium can cause contraction of blood vessels, affecting those with circulatory disorders.”<br>
5. Eat buckwheat<br>
Buckwheat’s grain-like seeds are the best source of rutin, a natural bioflavonoid that’s known to strengthen blood vessels. Use it in place of couscous, rice or other starchy grains or try it at breakfast in the form of buckwheat pancakes. <br>
6. Keep fit<br>
“Generally speaking, any cardiovascular exercise – walking, running, cycling – that gets you moving and raises your heart rate, will get your blood pumping around the body and boost circulation,” trainer and fitness expert Andy Lambourne says. <br>
7. Stand up at your desk<br>
“Sitting in the same position for long periods can give you bad circulation,” Lambourne says. “Women tend to cross their legs while at their desks, too. Not only is this bad for your posture, but it can be bad for the circulation. Make the time to lift your legs and do leg extensions under your desk – they’ll do wonders for your circulation.” <br>
8. Ditch the cigarettes<br>
Carbon monoxide in tobacco reduces the blood’s ability to carry oxygen, the free radicals in smoke destroy valuable antioxidants and nicotine raises blood pressure. “Long-term effects of smoking-related circulatory problems can, in extreme cases, result in the loss of a limb,” Harfleet says. <br>
9. Get your fill of folate<br>
This B vitamin has an essential role in the production of blood cells and contributes to the formation of haemoglobin. Increase your intake with generous portions of fruit, dark green, leafy vegetables, dried beans, peas and cereals that are fortified with folic acid. <br>
10. Start body brushing<br>
Before showering, briskly brush your skin with a bodybrush or loofah to stimulate your blood circulation and assist in healthy function of the lymphatic system. Use long, firm strokes in the direction of your heart. <br>
11. Add some ginkgo biloba<br>
A study by the University of Dundee Medical Research Institute in Scotland found this herb could relieve symptoms of Raynaud’s disease, a condition that causes blood vessels in the extremities (fingers and toes) to constrict, causing poor circulation and feelings of cold or pain. The herb is said to dilate blood vessels. <br>
12. Indulge in an aromatherapy massage<br>
Use a blend of carrier oil with a drop or two of active essential oils. “Cypress and juniper speed up your circulation, while lemon is a good stimulant,” aromatherapist Glenda Taylor says. <br>
13. Increase your intake of phytoestrogens<br>
These plant-derived compounds help reduce cholesterol levels, for a more efficient circulatory system. Good sources include soya, linseed, sunflower, pumpkin and sesame seeds. <br>
14. Monitor your levels of trace minerals<br>
Zinc, copper, manganese and selenium are all needed to help keep the arteries clear and functioning properly. Nuts, particularly brazil and cashew, are a good source, as are pumpkin seeds. <br>
15. Try taking hawthorn<br>
“It’s often recommended by herbalists as a circulatory tonic,” Harfleet says. “It can help in cases of reduced circulation, heart problems and high blood pressure – but consult a qualified practitioner before supplementing.” <br>
16. Get bouncing<br>
Make use of your kids’ trampoline because, according to a NASA report, rebounding is 70 per cent more effective than jogging for boosting fitness, which helps improve circulation. <br>
17. Eat oily fish once or twice a week<br>
“Omega-3 fatty acids in salmon, mackerel and herring make the blood less viscous, reducing the risk of thrombosis [blood clotting] and heart disease,” McKevith says. “They may also have a positive effect on blood pressure.” <br>
18. Load up on garlic<br>
This all-round tonic is a renowned blood cleanser, and fresh garlic is a great flavour addition to many dishes. <br>
19. Get your “Ommm” on<br>
Whatever your relaxing activity of choice – be it yoga, meditation or tai chi – observational studies have found that such therapies have a positive effect on heart function and circulation. <br>
20. Add some ginger<br>
This herb is a widely recognised circulatory aid, and tastes great in stir-fries or when made into a tea infusion. <br></p>
